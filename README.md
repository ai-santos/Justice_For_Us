# Justice_For_Us
Justice For Us is a social media web app built by activists for activists.

Description & Motivation:

I noticed a lot of my friends in the activist community have been using social media for purposes like exchanging resources, connecting through events, and keeping informed about direct action work. Recently, a few people in the activist community 
have had their posts removed, and their profile information shared with government agencies without permission. I decided to create a social network app that is built by a community member for the community. The main motivation for Justice_For_Us is to build solidarity, connection, and share resources amongst activists from various backgrounds. 

How to Fire Up the Project:
1. Fork a copy of Justice_For_Us on your github.
2. Git clone Justice_For_Us on your local computer.
3. open terminal and go into the repo'd folder.
4. open the folder in sublime using the command: subl .
5. There are 3 main pages to the project:
      a. Home
      b. Profile
      c. Projects
6. Each of the main pages contains separate JS and CSS files.
